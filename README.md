android-studio-unit-test-plugin
===============================

Android Studio IDE support for Android [gradle unit tests](https://github.com/JCAndKSolutions/android-unit-test).

This plugin will mark test directories and resolve `testCompile` dependencies. It also sets up the correct system properties so that Robolectric will work if you are using it.

### Requirements
* Android Studio `0.6.0+`
* Android Gradle Plugin `0.11.0+`
* JCAndKSolutions' android-unit-test gradle plugin `1.2.2+`

## Install IDE the plugin
In Android Studio go to `Settings -> Plugins -> Browse Repositories...` and search for 'Android Studio Unit Test'.

If you feel like living on the edge, can download the [zip](https://github.com/evant/android-studio-unit-test-plugin/raw/master/AndroidStudioUnitTestPlugin/AndroidStudioUnitTestPlugin.zip) then go to `Settings -> Plugins -> Install plugin from disk..` to install.

## Install the gradle plugin
To added unit testing support to your gradle project, you need JCAndKSolutions' android-unit-test gradle plugin.
You need to set it up as described in the [README](https://github.com/JCAndKSolutions/android-unit-test).
Make sure you have at least version `1.2.2`.

## Troubleshooting

* Running tests from the IDE gives a `ClassNotFoundException` or something similar.

  If your app includes a library project `compile project(":myLib")` then the JUnit test runner will attempt to run `testClasses` on that project. Since it doesn't have that task it will fail and your test classes will not be generated. To fix, add the needed task to your library project.

```groovy
task testClasses {}
```

* The relative path for Robolectric's `@Config(manifest = "path")` is different between gradle and Android Studio.

  This is because when creating a run configuration, the path is by default relative to your project root, whereas when running it from gradle it's correctly relative to your apps root. To fix, edit the JUnit run configuration and change `Working Directory` to point to your app root.

* Android Studio is not recognizing the test directories when first opening the project.

  Starting with `0.8.*`, Android Studio does not automatically refresh the project when it's opened. Doing this manually should fix this.
